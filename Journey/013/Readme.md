# Encryption

## Cloud Research
- Today, I've learned about several ways to encrypt data in AWS with different layers consisting network, database, account, and storage encryptions.

## __Encryption of Data in Transit__
You can mount a file system so all NFS traffic is encrypted in transit using Transport Layer Security 1.2 (TLS, formerly called Secure Sockets Layer [SSL]) with an industry-standard AES-256 cipher. TLS is a set of industry-standard cryptographic protocols used for encrypting information that is exchanged over the wire. AES-256 is a 256-bit encryption cipher used for data transmission in TLS. If your organization is subject to corporate or regulatory policies that require encryption of data and metadata in transit, we recommend setting up encryption in transit on every client accessing the file system.

## __Encryption of Data at Rest__
You can create an encrypted file system so all your data and metadata is encrypted at rest using an industry-standard AES-256 encryption algorithm. Encryption and decryption is handled automatically and transparently, so you donâ€™t have to modify your applications. If your organization is subject to corporate or regulatory policies that require encryption of data and metadata at rest, we recommend creating an encrypted file system.

## __AWS Key Management Service (KMS)__
AWS Key Management Service (KMS) makes it easy for you to create and manage keys and control the use of encryption across a wide range of AWS services and in your applications. AWS KMS is a secure and resilient service that uses FIPS 140-2 validated hardware security modules to protect your keys. AWS KMS is integrated with AWS CloudTrail to provide you with logs of all key usage to help meet your regulatory and compliance needs.

## __AWS CloudHSM__
AWS CloudHSM is a cloud-based hardware security module (HSM) that enables you to easily generate and use your own encryption keys on the AWS Cloud. With CloudHSM, you can manage your own encryption keys using FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSMs. CloudHSM offers you the flexibility to integrate with your applications using industry-standard APIs, such as PKCS#11, Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE), and Microsoft CryptoNG (CNG) libraries.  CloudHSM is standards-compliant and enables you to export all of your keys to most other commercially-available HSMs, subject to your configurations. It is a fully-managed service that automates time-consuming administrative tasks for you, such as hardware provisioning, software patching, high-availability, and backups. CloudHSM also enables you to scale quickly by adding and removing HSM capacity on-demand, with no up-front costs.

## __Database Encryption__
Amazon RDS allows you to encrypt your databases using keys you manage through AWS Key Management Service (KMS). On a database instance running with Amazon RDS encryption, data stored at rest in the underlying storage is encrypted, as are its automated backups, read replicas, and snapshots. Amazon RDS supports Transparent Data Encryption in SQL Server and Oracle. Transparent Data Encryption in Oracle is integrated with AWS CloudHSM, which allows you to securely generate, store, and manage your cryptographic keys in single-tenant Hardware Security Module (HSM) appliances within the AWS cloud. Amazon RDS supports the use of SSL to secure data in transit.

## __Amazon S3 Default Encryption for S3 Buckets__
Amazon S3 default encryption provides a way to set the default encryption behavior for an S3 bucket. You can set default encryption on a bucket so that all objects are encrypted when they are stored in the bucket. The objects are encrypted using server-side encryption with either Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS).

## __EBS Encryption__
Amazon EBS encryption offers seamless encryption of EBS data volumes, boot volumes and snapshots, eliminating the need to build and manage a secure key management infrastructure. EBS encryption enables data at rest security by encrypting your data volumes, boot volumes and snapshots using Amazon-managed keys or keys you create and manage using the AWS Key Management Service (KMS). In addition, the encryption occurs on the servers that host EC2 instances, providing encryption of data as it moves between EC2 instances and EBS data and boot volumes.
