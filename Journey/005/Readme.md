# AWS Networking

## Cloud Research
- Today, I've learned about what AWS networking is including how to configure express IP addresses with CIDR notation, and setting up VPC with security configuration for web server.

## __What Is Networking?__
Networking is how you connect computers around the world and allow them to communicate with one another. In this trail, youâ€™ve already seen a few examples of networking. One is the AWS global infrastructure. AWS has created a network of resources using data centers, Availability Zones, and Regions.

### __What Are IP Addresses?__
In order to properly route your messages to a location, you need an address. Just like each home has a mail address, each computer has an IP address. However, instead of using the combination of street, city, state, zip code, and country, the IP address uses a combination of bits, 0s and 1s.

### __Use CIDR Notation__
192.168.1.30 is a single IP address. If you wanted to express IP addresses between the range of 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.1.255, how can you do that? One way is by using _Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation_. CIDR notation is a compressed way of specifying a range of IP addresses. Specifying a range determines how many IP addresses are available to you.

## Secure Your Network with Amazon VPC Security
### __The Main Route Table__
When you create a VPC, AWS creates a route table called the main route table. A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed. AWS assumes that when you create a new VPC with subnets, you want traffic to flow between them. Therefore, the default configuration of the main route table is to allow traffic between all subnets in the local network.

### __Custom Route Tables__
While the main route table controls the routing for your VPC, you may want to be more granular about how you route your traffic for specific subnets. For example, your application may consist of a frontend and a database. You can create separate subnets for these resources and provide different routes for each of them.

If you associate a custom route table with a subnet, the subnet will use it instead of the main route table. By default, each custom route table you create will have the local route already inside it, allowing communication to flow between all resources and subnets inside the VPC.

### __Secure Your Subnets with Network ACLs__
Think of a network ACL as a firewall at the subnet level. A network ACL enables you to control what kind of traffic is allowed to enter or leave your subnet. You can configure this by setting up rules that define what you want to filter.

I'm not going to post my progression on social media.
