# Monitoring Serverless Applications

## Cloud Research
Today, I've learned about monitoring AWS SAM application. After you deploy your serverless application to the AWS Cloud, you need to verify that it's operating properly on an ongoing basis. To simplify troubleshooting, the AWS SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. This command lets you fetch logs generated by your Lambda function from the command line.

## __Fetching logs by AWS CloudFormation stack__
When your function is a part of an AWS CloudFormation stack, you can fetch logs by using the function's logical ID:
```sh
sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name mystack
```

## __Viewing logs for a specific time range__
Use the `--filter` option to quickly find logs that match terms, phrases, or values in your log events:
```sh
sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name mystack --filter "error"
```
In the output, the AWS SAM CLI underlines all occurrences of the word "error" so you can easily locate the filter keyword within the log output.

## __Error highlighting__
When your Lambda function crashes or times out, the AWS SAM CLI highlights the timeout message in red. This helps you easily locate specific executions that are timing out within a giant stream of log output.

## __JSON pretty printing__
If your log messages print JSON strings, the AWS SAM CLI automatically pretty prints the JSON to help you visually parse and understand the JSON.

## Social Proof
I'm not going to post my progression on social media.
