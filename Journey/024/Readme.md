# Amazon Lex in Practice

## Cloud Research
- Today, I've get hands-on exercise creating a simple web-based chatbot application which leverage multiple AWS services to build an application. Today I've set up a simple bot with Amazon Lex. Note that, Lex requires you to specify intents and slots in order to give a context to your bot, that means the bot is not supported all general scenarios. Amazon Lex also need the permission for Amazon Polly which is a service that turns text into lifelike speech. By the way, at first, we are starting off building a text-based application. 

## Social Proof
I'm not going to post my progression on social media.
