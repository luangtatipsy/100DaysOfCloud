# Amazon Lex

## Cloud Research
- Today, I've learned about Amazon Lex which is a service that allows you creating a chatbot into any application using voice and text. It uses an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to convert an audio input to a text format then, recognize its intents. With these techniques you are able to create applications with highly engaging user experiences.

## Social Proof
I'm not going to post my progression on social media.
