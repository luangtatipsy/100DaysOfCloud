# AWS SAM Accelerate

## Cloud Research
Today, I've learned about how to speed up deployments from a development environment to AWS Cloud. You can use AWS SAM Accelerate to update and monitor serverless applications in AWS Cloud during development. AWS SAM Accelerate speeds up deployments from your development environment to the AWS Cloud by using AWS service APIs instead of AWS CloudFormation to deploy code updates. AWS SAM Accelerate also supports automatic deployments to the AWS Cloud as you make changes to your application.

By deploying to the AWS Cloud during development, you can identify issues with your application that are difficult to detect in your local environment. For example, testing in the AWS Cloud can help you identify issues with IAM roles or API authorization.

## Social Proof
I'm not going to post my progression on social media.
