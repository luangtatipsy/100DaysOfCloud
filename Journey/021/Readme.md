# AWS Schema Conversion Tool

## Cloud Research
- Today, I've learned about AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) which is able to convert a database schema from an engine to another different one.

## __AWS Schema Conversion Tool__
AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) is provided to convert your existing database schema from one database engine to another. You can convert relational OLTP schema, or data warehouse schema. Your converted schema is suitable for an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL DB, an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, or an Amazon Redshift cluster. The converted schema can also be used with a database on an Amazon EC2 instance or stored as data on an Amazon S3 bucket.

## Social Proof
I'm not going to post my progression on social media.
