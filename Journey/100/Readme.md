# Getting Started with AWS CodeBuild using the Console
## Cloud Research
Today, I've gotten a hands-on experience with AWS CodeBuild which consist of these following steps:
  - Step 1: Create the source code
  - Step 2: Create the buildspec file
  - Step 3: Create two S3 buckets
  - Step 4: Upload the source code and the buildspec file
  - Step 5: Create the build project
  - Step 6: Run the build
  - Step 7: View summarized build information
  - Step 8: View detailed build information
  - Step 9: Get the build output artifact
  - Step 10: Delete the S3 buckets

For more information, see a [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/getting-started.html).

## Social Proof
I'm not going to post my progression on social media.
