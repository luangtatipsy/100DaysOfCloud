# Building a Multi-Container Application #1

## Cloud Research
- Today, I've completed a concept and plan for creating more complex application. The application is a fibonacci calculator which allows us input an index of fibonacci sequence. The demonstration is going to solve fibonacci problem with recursive solution which is very expensive for computation. However, it is appropriate way to show how a complex application works.

Components for this application comprise of front-end web client (React), back-end web server (Express.js), and databases which are PostgresSQL for a relational database, and Redis for cache database connecting them by a worker. The following figure shows an overall workflow of this application.

## Social Proof
I'm not going to post my progression on social media.
