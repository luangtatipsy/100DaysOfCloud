# Imperative vs Declarative Deployments

## Cloud Research
- Today, I've learned about differences between imperative, and declarative deployments. Both of those types of deployment are supported by Kubernetes, however, the biggest different one is imperative deployment is you have to update/remove on every single container yourself. For example on the first and second diagrams below, you are going to remove one of containers, you have to run a command on a certain container you would like to remove. The second one is updating multiple containers. The last diagram is declarative deployment that let Kubernetes master API do what you would like to do by giving it a configuration file.
