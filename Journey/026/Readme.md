# Amazon CloudFront

## Cloud Research
- Today, I've learned about Amazon CloudFront which is a content delivery network (CDN) service. For example, if you are maintaining a web application which is used for users around the world, there is an issue for far from home users requesting access static content of the web from a long distance from the web server, it will takes so much time to load the static content.

__Amazon CloudFront__ is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.

__Amazon CloudFront__ offers the most advanced security capabilities, including field level encryption and HTTPS support, seamlessly integrated with AWS Shield, AWS Web Application Firewall and Amazon Route 53 to protect against multiple types of attacks including network and application layer DDoS attacks. These services co-reside at edge networking locations – globally scaled and connected via the AWS network backbone – providing a more secure, performant, and available experience for your users.

__Amazon CloudFront__ works seamlessly with any AWS origin, such as Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, or with any custom HTTP origin. You can customize your content delivery through CloudFront using the secure and programmable edge computing features CloudFront Functions and AWS Lambda@Edge.

## Social Proof
