# Kubernetes Ingress
## Cloud Research
Today, I've learned about Kubernetes Ingress which is an API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP.

## __What is Ingress?__
Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.

## Social Proof
I'm not going to post my progression on social media.
