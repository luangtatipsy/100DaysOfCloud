# Preparation of Planning and Analysis

## Cloud Research
- Today, I've learned about a conclusion of preparation through planning and analysis. Our goal here is to continue to stress how important the preparation phases of a migration are before taking any major actions. Additionally, getting a clear picture of your application portfolio becomes a bigger part of the conversation because you need to better know how each component, function, and resource is going to migrate, and how they will work together in the new environment. 

## __Elastic Beanstalk__
With Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without having to learn about the infrastructure that runs those applications. Elastic Beanstalk reduces management complexity without restricting choice or control. This can be a useful tool for you to utilize when testing functionality of your applications in AWS.

## __The Security Pillar__
It is important, while evaluating your portfolio, to evaluate the ability to protect your information, systems, and assets. Security should be a major part of the planning, and should be considered from early in the process all the way through to operational phases of your migrations.

## __AWS Migration HUB__
AWS Migration Hub provides a rich web experience that helps you understand your existing IT assets as well as view and track progress of application migrations. It lets you collect and view data about on-premises resources, group those resources into applications, and track the progress of those applications as you migrate to AWS.

## __What Do You Need to Know Before Your Start?__
Database migration is a complex, multiphase process, which usually includes assessment, database schema conversion script conversion, data migration, functional testing, performance tuning, and many other steps.

## __Migration Delivery Partners__
Migration Delivery Partners help customers through every stage of migration, accelerating results by providing personnel, tools, and education in the form of professional services. These partners either are, or have a relationship with, an AWS audited Managed Service Provider to help you with ongoing support of AWS workloads.

## Social Proof
I'm not going to post my progression on social media.
