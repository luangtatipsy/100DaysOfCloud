# VM Import and VM on AWS

## Cloud Research
- Today, I've learned about AWS Migration Hub.

## __What is VM Import/Export?__
AWS Migration Hub provides a single location to track the progress of application migrations across multiple AWS and partner solutions. Using Migration Hub allows you to choose the AWS and partner migration tools that best fit your needs, while providing visibility into the status of migrations across your portfolio of applications. Migration Hub also provides key metrics and progress for individual applications, regardless of which tools are being used to migrate them. This allows you to quickly get progress updates across all of your migrations, easily identify and troubleshoot any issues, and reduce the overall time and effort spent on your migration projects.

AWS Migration Hub provides a single place to monitor migrations in any AWS region where your migration tools are available. There is no additional cost for using Migration Hub. You only pay for the cost of the individual migration tools you use, and any resources being consumed on AWS.


## Social Proof
I'm not going to post my progression on social media.
