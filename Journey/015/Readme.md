# Cloud Migration

## Cloud Research
- Today, I've learned about 5-phrases approach for migrating to a cloud:
  1. Migration preparation and business planning
  2. Portfolio discovery and planning
  3. Designing, migrating your applications
  4. Validating your applications
  5. Operate

## __1.  Migration preparation and business planning__
planning and preparation will be where most of the time and effort are spent. While individual, non-crucial, stand-alone systems may have the ability to be quickly moved over with little planning, it's because these provide minimal risk for impact, should an issue occur.

## __2. Portfolio discovery and planning__
The goal is to establish where our dependencies are between our applications, and begin thinking about what types of migrations might work best for each. Not every application is likely to fall into the same migration strategy. This phase, with a focus on application discovery, is our best opportunity for building a clear use case and business case for each application.

## __3-4. Designing, migrating and validating your applications__
We're still planning with our designs, but we then migrate and validate. Here the focus starts to shift from the portfolio level to the individual application level, where you're designing, migrating, and validating each application. Each application is designed, migrated, and validated according to one of the six common application strategies (will be discussed later).

## __5. Operate__
Phase five is an ongoing phase, taking all of the information and lessons learned from our migration and working towards continual improvement. There are many migration partners available to help you better operate in the cloud and become more proficient in your migrations.

## Social Proof
I'm not going to post my progression on social media.
