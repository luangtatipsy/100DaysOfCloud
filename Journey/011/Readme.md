# Addressing Security Risks

## Cloud Research
- Today, I've learned about how to secure a company's employee accounts with IAM, and AWS Organization. AWS organization is consolidated billing which help you to roll up billings from multiple AWS accounts to a central master account. Furthermore, AWS provides AWS Cloud Directory, it lets you are able to mangage single sign-on system.

## __AWS Organizations__
AWS Organizations helps you centrally govern your environment as you grow and scale your workloads on AWS. Whether you are a growing startup or a large enterprise, Organizations helps you to centrally manage billing; control access, compliance, and security; and share resources across your AWS accounts.

## __Amazon Cloud Directory__
Amazon Cloud Directory enables you to build flexible cloud-native directories for organizing hierarchies of data along multiple dimensions. With Cloud Directory, you can create directories for a variety of use cases, such as organizational charts, course catalogs, and device registries. While traditional directory solutions, such as Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) and other LDAP-based directories, limit you to a single hierarchy, Cloud Directory offers you the flexibility to create directories with hierarchies that span multiple dimensions. For example, you can create an organizational chart that can be navigated through separate hierarchies for reporting structure, location, and cost center.

## Social Proof
I'm not going to post my progression on social media.
