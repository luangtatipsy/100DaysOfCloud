# What is AWS CodeBuild?
## Cloud Research
Today, I've learned about AWS CodeBuild which is a fully managed build service in the cloud. CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for popular programming languages and build tools such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also customize build environments in CodeBuild to use your own build tools. CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build requests.

CodeBuild provides these benefits:
  - __Fully managed__ – CodeBuild eliminates the need to set up, patch, update, and manage your own build servers.
  - __On demand__ – CodeBuild scales on demand to meet your build needs. You pay only for the number of build minutes you consume.
  - __Out of the box__ – CodeBuild provides preconfigured build environments for the most popular programming languages. All you need to do is point to your build script to start your first build.

For more information, see a [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html).

## Social Proof
I'm not going to post my progression on social media.
