# Publishing Serverless Applications using the AWS SAM CLI

## Cloud Research
Today, I've learned about publishing a AWS SAM application. To make your AWS SAM application available for others to find and deploy, you can use the AWS SAM CLI to publish it to the AWS Serverless Application Repository. To publish your application using the AWS SAM CLI, you must define it using an AWS SAM template. You also must have tested it locally or in the AWS Cloud.

Follow the instructions in this topic to create a new application, create a new version of an existing application, or update the metadata of an existing application. (What you do depends on whether the application already exists in the AWS Serverless Application Repository, and whether any application metadata is changing.) For more information about this tutorial, see a [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-template-publishing-applications.html).
