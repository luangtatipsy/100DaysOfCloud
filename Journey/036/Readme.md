# Making Real Projects with Docker

## Cloud Research
- Today, I've learned about how to build multiple containers, and serve them with `docker compose`. For this exercise, I create a simple website that count a number of visitor, and store it into Redis database.

## __Starting Commands__
```sh
cd src
docker compose up --build
```
After execute the second command, you should be able to visit the website at [http://localhost:4001](http://localhost:4001/)

## Social Proof
I'm not going to post my progression on social media.
