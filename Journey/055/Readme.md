# Minikube

## Cloud Research
- Today, I've learned about Minikube, and install it on my local machine.

## __What is Minikube?__
Minikube is local Kubernetes, focusing on making it easy to learn and develop for Kubernetes. All you need is Docker (or similarly compatible) container or a Virtual Machine environment, and Kubernetes is a single command away: `minikube start`. For more detail, please visit a [documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/).

## Social Proof
I'm not going to post my progression on social media.
